## Jeremy gave this Ted talk

Platform.AI wants to put the power of deep learning in the hands of product managers and business users. By providing custom-built pre-trained models, an intuitive user-interface and zero coding/devops, we enable non-engineers to apply modern deep learning capabilities to their data. Users can quickly assemble image classification, similarity and object detection applications even if the data is unlabeled and they have no previous background or experience in machine learning.
